## About The Project

This project is a simple chat client, where users can communicate with other users

## Getting Started

## <a name="build">ðŸš€ Build</a>

In order to build the app for production, run the following command :

```
# Clone the app
git clone https://github.com/thatsZeed/TCPChatClient.git

# Run the app
dotnet run
```

## Usage

This chat client can be used for chatting between clients. The server establishes a connection to the selected port, where it waits for incoming connections. The client connects to the server via the port in order to communicate with it.
A tcp listener then monitors the data traffic which is listened to via the port. Finally, the messages will be displayed in the chat window
